                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I started wanting to learn how to code back in my sophomore year of <strong>High School</strong> when taking a <em>web design</em> class. From that then I decided I wanted to pursue coding going into the future as it was something I loved learning. My major is now <strong>Software Development</strong> and I am dedicated to learning about coding.</p>
                <p>While in my first year then I plan to spend 2 years at <strong>College of Western Idaho</strong>. Once I have finished my 2 years in CWI then I will be left with the decision of starting work or <em>go to Boise State University</em>. What happens will be <em>dependant</em> on how much I have learned and what options are available to me.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Hiring</h2>
                <p>I will have finished my 2 year degree at <strong>CWI</strong> in <em>Spring of 2026</em>. While there is the <em>change</em> I go to <strong>Boise State University</strong> after then I am hoping to get an internship if I do go that path. Contact me!</p>
